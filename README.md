# Project Overview
For this project, we will be developing a shopping cart application. When the user opens the application, they will be presented with a login window. Depending on if they have an account or not, they will either log in or sign up. Once an account is created, depending on what kind of account they have (a customer or the seller), the application performs different functions. Customers will be able to purchase items from the seller. Sellers will be able to manage their inventory.

 
# Minimal Functional Specification
A customer logs in with a username and password. If the user does not have an account, they will be invited to sign up for one as a customer. Only one admin should exist as this system is being developed for a single customer. When the customer logs in, a window (frame) opens where he can browse through a list of available products that includes the product name, price, and available quantity. From this window, the customer can select products and add them to the shopping cart by clicking on a plus symbol next to the product name, or they can click on a product name and get the full product description, pricing, and availability (quantity available) in a pop-up window. Exiting this pop-up window will return you back to the home page. The customer can add the product to the shopping cart (quantity), depending on availability. If a selected product is unavailable, the customer will not be able to add it to their shopping cart but can still view the product details. The shopping cart total amount is kept current on the main product browse window. The customer can proceed to checkout at any time. By checking out, a new window is displayed showing the contents of the shopping cart. The shopping cart can be updated on the new checkout window by changing the item count for each product in the cart, keeping in mind the availability of each product in inventory. At checkout, the customer verifies the shopping cart content and pays for the goods by supplying a credit card(simulated). A simulated credit card assumes that the customer has sufficient funds to purchase their goods. The application does not arrange for shipping. 
When the seller logs in, a window opens where the current state of the inventory is shown. The current state shows all products that are available (one or more) and products that are out of stock (0 in inventory). The seller can update the stock by adding products - specifying product name, invoice price, and sell price, and by updating the available quantity by either incrementing or decrementing it. The internal product representation includes ID, type, quantity, invoice price, selling price, and product images. The application must keep track of all costs, revenues, and profits. This information will be on a separate window from the inventory window. The seller can access this information from the application UI.

- [] 
### The customer selects the “+” button next to the product name
The product and its quantity of 1 is added to the customer's shopping cart

- [] 
#### Variant Scenario: Product Inventory Quantity is 0
In the case that when adding a product to the shopping cart, the inventory quantity is 0, a message shall be presented to the customer stating that there is no more of the product in the inventory

- []
### The customer selects the “+” button near the product name and quantity in the shopping cart.
Product inventory quantity value is already 0, send a message to the customer saying:
“This product has been sold out”
Product inventory quantity value stays at 0 and the Customer product shopping cart is not updated with new product

- [] 
### Customer Adds More Existing Items in Shopping Cart
The customer shall be able to increase the quantity of a specific product in their shopping cart view so that they don’t have to search for the item in the shopping view and click it multiple times

### Customer enters their shopping cart view
The customer selects the “+” button near the product name and quantity in the shopping cart. Increments value by 1.

#### Variant Scenario: Product Inventory Quantity is Max
In the case that when incrementing quantity in the shopping cart, the inventory quantity is equal to the shopping cart quantity, a message shall be presented to the customer stating that there is no more of the product in the inventory

### The customer selects the “+” button near the product name and quantity in the shopping cart.
Product inventory quantity value is already equal to shopping cart qunatity, send a message to the customer saying:
“This product has been maxed out”
 
### Customer Removes Item from Shopping Cart
The customer shall be able to remove items from their shopping cart by clicking a button inside of their shopping cart view so that they can get rid of any items that they end up not wanting to purchase
 
### Customer enters their shopping cart view

Shopping cart product quantity is updated by -1
 
#### Variant Scenario: Product Shopping Cart Quantity hits 0
In the event that the customer turns the quantity of a product in their shopping cart to 0, the product listing in the shopping cart will be removed completely. This is to prevent going to -1

Admin(seller) has logged in and is presented with the admin homepage.
A list of products the seller has imputed will be presented
In each product box, there will be text fields where the user may edit information.
The admin can enter new information in these text fields to update price, quantity, title, and description.
After the admin has filled out these text fields and clicks a submit button, the information will update in the system. 
If a text field is empty the information will not update to nil, it will maintain the current data.
A plus will exist on the product image, pressing this will open up a popup window to select a file to replace the current image.

# Platforms
For this project we will use multiple different platforms and libraries to successfully implement our idea. Below is a list of software and libraries we shall be using to organize our code, create diagrams, sketch out frameworks, and perform certain implementations of our code.
Software

Github
Github shall be used to keep all of our code organized into one place. We will also have accessibility to version control. While using Github, we can all review each others code and make sure it complies with our overarching goals

LucidChart
This software is where we shall create our UML diagrams such as the class diagram, sequence diagram, and state diagram.

Apache Netbeans IDE 14
Netbean will be the most commonly used IDE for this project to compile our code.

Figma
This online free software will allow us to design our frames without adding any functionality to it. Using figma allows us the ability to pick the perfect design for each window

Java
This project will be run by Java and its libraries. As an object Oriented environment, this language is best suited for what we are going to be implementing.
Libraries

The Following are libraries we will be importing into our application to implement our ideas. This project will be coded in Java so all libraries will be associated with Java

Swing
This library will be imported into our application because it gives us access to a GUI widget toolkit for Java that provides us with frames, layouts, labels, etc.
